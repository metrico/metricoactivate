When to use TA_USER or TA_SYSTEM
=======================================

TA_USER saves the activation or trial data in the current user's profile if
(and only if) calling the function with TA_SYSTEM had not previously occurred.

TA_SYSTEM saves the activation or trial data in a place accessible by all user
profiles on the system.


In both cases the product key is activated and "locked" to the machine. The
only difference between TA_SYSTEM and TA_USER is where the files are stored.
In other words if one users activates your app on a machine using TA_USER,
another user can activate your app on the same machine, using the same product
key.

If you want to license your software per-user on machines, then use TurboFloat:

https://wyday.com/limelm/help/using-turbofloat/



For almost all cases we recommend using TA_SYSTEM.

   This is meant as a replacement of both TA_IsActivated() and TA_IsGenuine(). Call this at the
   top of your program and let TA_IsGenuineEx() handle all the details.

   This differs with TA_IsGenuine() in 3 major ways:

        1. You can specify how often to verify with the LimeLM servers and it handles
           all the date tracking behind the scenes.


        2. TA_IsGenuineEx() prevents your app from hammering the end-user's network after
           and TA_E_INET error return code by not checking with the LimeLM servers until
           at least 5 hours has passed. If you call TA_IsGenuineEx() after a TA_E_INET return
           and before 5 hours has elapsed then this function will return TA_E_INET_DELAYED.

           (If you give the user the option to recheck with LimeLM, e.g. via a button
           like "Retry now" then call TA_IsGenuine() to immediately retry without waiting 5 hours).


        3. If a TA_E_INET error is being returned, and the grace period has expired,
           then TA_IsGenuineEx() will return TA_FAIL. TA_IsGenuineEx() will continue to try
           contacting the LimeLM servers on subsequent calls (5 hours apart), but you
           should treat the TA_FAIL as a hard failure.


   Returns: TA_OK or TA_E_FEATURES_CHANGED on success. Handle TA_E_INET and TA_E_INET_DELAYED as warnings that
            you should let the end user know about.

            as a more "catch-all" inernet failure. This is the only TurboActivate function that will

 On Windows the TurboActivate.dat must be in the same folder as the TurboActivate.dll file.

 folder as the executable calling the TurboActivate functions. Also, on Windows,
 if you're using static linking with the TurboActivate library then the TurboActivate.dat
 must be in the same folder as the executable (or DLL) using the TurboActivate library
 functions.

 On Mac OS X this can be confusing because a ".app" file isn't really a file
 at all, it's just a folder (or "bundle") that contains assets, and a few levels
 of directories like this:

 MyApp.app/
     Contents/
         Info.plist
         MacOS/
         Resources/

 In a Mac OS X application bundle the "actual executable" is inside the "MacOS"
 folder. That's where your should put TurboActivate.dat.


 If you can't or don't want to include TurboActivate.dat alongside TurboActivate.dll
 on Windows or alongside your app on Unix, or you just want to rename TurboActivate.dat
 to something else, then your only option is to call TA_PDetsFromPath().

 MessageText:

 The secure connection to the activation servers failed due to a TLS or certificate
 error. This is most often caused by MITM (man-in-the-middle) attempts on corporate
 networks or, if on Unix operating systems (macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.), it's caused
 by out-of-date or missing "CA certificates". This means either keeping your system
 itself up-to-date, or manually updating the CA certs.
